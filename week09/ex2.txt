We will increase hit/miss ratio if in sequence there will be often repeating page numbers with rarely placed unique
page numbers, like: "1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 7 1 2 3 4 5 8...". 0 hits can be reached in case when all page numbers 
in sequence are unique hence we will have minumum possible hit/miss ratio which is 0.
